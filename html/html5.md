## What’s New in HTML5

- **Semantic tags** (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`)  
  Clearly define page structure, making HTML easier to understand, more accessible, and SEO-friendly.

- **Native audio & video** (`<audio>`, `<video>`)  
  Allows playing media directly in the browser without plugins like Flash.

- **New form input types** (`email`, `date`, `number`, `range`)  
  Provide better user input, built-in validation, and show the correct keyboard on mobile devices (like number or email keyboard).

- **Form attributes** (`required`, `placeholder`, `pattern`)  
  Reduce the need for JavaScript for basic form validation.

- **Better accessibility support**  
  Semantic elements and attributes help screen readers understand page layout.

- **Cleaner DOCTYPE**  
  Simple `<!DOCTYPE html>` ensures standard rendering in all modern browsers.

- **Built-in browser APIs** (overview)  
  Support for features like local storage, offline data, and geolocation (via APIs).
