# 🟧 HTML – Introduction

## What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is a **markup language** used to **structure and describe content** on the web.

It defines **what content is**, not **how it looks** or **how it behaves**.

## Why & Uses of HTML

HTML exists to:

- Provide a **standard structure** for web pages
- Add **semantic meaning** to content
- Enable **hyperlink-based navigation**
- Help **search engines** understand pages (SEO)
- Help **screen readers** support disabled users
- Create **forms** for user interaction
- Act as the **foundation** for CSS and JavaScript
- Ensure **consistent rendering** across browsers and devices

> Every website, SPA, or framework-based app ultimately relies on HTML.
