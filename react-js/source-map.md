# ⚛️ Source Map

A source map is a file that maps compiled, bundled, or minified JavaScript code
back to the original source code, allowing developers to debug the original code
in the browser.

## Why Source Maps Are Needed

- Modern JavaScript code is often:
  - transpiled (TypeScript, JSX → JavaScript)
  - bundled
  - minified for performance
- Browsers run the compiled code, not the original code.
- Without source maps:
  - error messages are hard to understand
  - line numbers do not match the original code
- Source maps make debugging easier by showing the original source code.

## How Source Maps Are Generated

- Source maps are generated by build tools like:
  - Webpack
  - Vite
  - Babel
- During the build process:
  - the build tool generates **two files**:
    - `main.js` → compiled JavaScript file (runs in the browser)
    - `main.js.map` → source map file (used for debugging)
  - `main.js` contains a `sourceMappingURL` comment that points to `main.js.map`

### How `sourceMappingURL` Works

```js
//# sourceMappingURL=main.js.map
```

- The browser runs the compiled JavaScript file (`main.js`)
- DevTools reads the `sourceMappingURL` comment
- DevTools loads the source map file (`main.js.map`)
- Errors and breakpoints are shown using the original source code

> The browser executes compiled code, while source maps are used only for debugging.

## How to Toggle Source Maps in Browser DevTools

You can enable or disable source maps directly from the browser DevTools.

### Steps to Toggle Source Maps

1. Open **Browser DevTools** (Right-click → Inspect)
2. Click the **Settings (⚙️) icon** in DevTools
3. Go to the **Preferences** section
4. Find **Sources**
5. Enable or disable **“Enable JavaScript source maps”**
6. Reload the page to see the effect

### What You Will Notice

- When source maps are **enabled**:
  - You see original files (JSX, TS, ES6)
  - Errors point to original line numbers
- When source maps are **disabled**:
  - You see compiled or minified code only
  - Errors point to bundled files

> This setting is useful for understanding how source maps work in real projects.
